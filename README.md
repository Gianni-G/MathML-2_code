# MathML-2_code

This repository features a computational implementation giving access to the
experimental data presented in section ยง6 of the paper "Content from
Expressions: The Place of Textuality in Deep Learning Approaches to
Mathematics".

This is a work in progress. The final version will be produced upon publication
of the paper. The main elements can already be tested using the `ML-2.ipynb`
notebook.
